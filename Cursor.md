I need to be blunt here. Your question is vague and probably unrealistic.

First, what do you mean by “make a cursor”? Do you work at Cursor AI? Are you planning to fork their codebase? Build a competitor from scratch? Or just theorizing?

Because if you’re starting from zero, you’re not going to beat VSCode, IntelliJ, or Cursor itself. The IDE market is brutal. Microsoft has thousands of engineers and billions in resources. JetBrains has decades of expertise. Cursor has significant VC funding and AI partnerships.

But let’s say you actually have resources and a team. Here’s what would matter:

**Speed matters most**
Your IDE needs to open instantly and never lag. Most fail here. If your editor freezes when opening large files, you lose.

**AI integration that actually works**
Cursor succeeded because their AI feels natural, not bolted on. Most AI coding tools feel clunky. You’d need something better than GPT-4 and Claude, integrated so well that developers forget it’s AI.

**Language support without compromise**
Support every major language perfectly. Half-working Python support or buggy TypeScript kills adoption.

**Plugin ecosystem**
Without plugins, you’re dead. But building a plugin ecosystem takes years and requires existing users.

**Migration path**
Developers won’t switch unless you can import their existing setup seamlessly.

The honest truth? You probably can’t build the “best IDE in the world.” The market is too competitive and established.

What specific problem with current IDEs are you trying to solve? That’s where you should start.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
