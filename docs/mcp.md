To implement a LEGO builder within Minecraft using the Mod Coder Pack (MCP), a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) outlines the technical details for the mod.

## Technical Requirements Document: Minecraft LEGO Builder Mod (Concise)

### 1. Introduction

This mod aims to integrate a virtual LEGO building experience directly into Minecraft Java Edition, allowing users to construct models with custom LEGO bricks, similar to LEGO Digital Designer, using the Mod Coder Pack (MCP).

### 2. Overall Architecture

The mod will function as a client-side and potentially server-side extension for Minecraft, leveraging MCP for integration. Client components will handle rendering and user input, while server components will manage build data and synchronization in multiplayer.

### 3. Key Modules

#### 3.1. LEGO Block Definitions

Implement various LEGO brick types (e.g., 1x1, 2x1, 2x2) as custom Minecraft blocks. Each brick will have unique 3D models, textures, and support for multiple colors. Metadata will store brick type, color, and orientation.

#### 3.2. Placement Mechanics

A dedicated "LEGO Builder Tool" will enable custom placement. This includes a snapping system for precise alignment, user-controlled rotation of bricks, and custom collision detection to mimic real LEGO interactions.

#### 3.3. Rendering System

Custom block renderers will be developed to display the non-cube shapes of LEGO bricks accurately. This involves registering custom render IDs and potentially using `TileEntitySpecialRender` for complex models to ensure proper visual representation.

#### 3.4. Inventory and Selection

A custom in-game user interface (UI) or palette will allow users to select different LEGO brick types and colors, potentially including search and filtering options.

#### 3.5. Save/Load Functionality

LEGO build data (brick type, color, position, orientation) will be stored persistently within the Minecraft world's data, requiring efficient serialization and deserialization methods.

### 4. Technical Challenges

Key challenges include optimizing performance for large LEGO builds, ensuring compatibility across various Minecraft versions supported by MCP-Reborn (1.13-1.21.4), and accurately rendering complex LEGO geometries within Minecraft's engine.

### 5. Development Environment

Development will primarily use Java, the Java Development Kit (JDK), an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, and the Mod Coder Pack (MCP) (potentially with Minecraft Forge) for modding. Git will be used for version control.
