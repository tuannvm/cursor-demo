# GitHub Issues Created from MCP TRD

This document summarizes the GitHub issues created from the Minecraft LEGO Builder Mod Technical Requirements Document (TRD).

## Issue Structure

Each major component follows a three-phase approach:
1. **Planning Phase** - Requirements analysis and design
2. **Implementation Phase** - Actual development work  
3. **Testing Phase** - Validation and quality assurance

## Created Issue Templates

### 1. Development Environment Setup
- `dev-setup-planning.md` - Plan development environment
- `dev-setup-implementation.md` - Set up Java, IDE, MCP, project structure
- `dev-setup-testing.md` - Validate development environment

### 2. LEGO Block Definitions  
- `lego-blocks-planning.md` - Design LEGO brick types and metadata
- `lego-blocks-implementation.md` - Implement custom Minecraft blocks
- `lego-blocks-testing.md` - Test block functionality and rendering

### 3. Placement Mechanics
- `placement-mechanics-planning.md` - Design LEGO Builder Tool
- `placement-mechanics-implementation.md` - Implement snapping and rotation
- `placement-mechanics-testing.md` - Test placement accuracy and controls

### 4. Rendering System
- `rendering-system-planning.md` - Design custom rendering for non-cube shapes
- `rendering-system-implementation.md` - Implement TileEntitySpecialRender
- `rendering-system-testing.md` - Test visual quality and performance

### 5. Inventory and Selection UI
- `inventory-ui-planning.md` - Design brick selection interface
- `inventory-ui-implementation.md` - Create custom GUI with search/filter
- `inventory-ui-testing.md` - Test UI functionality and usability

### 6. Save/Load Functionality
- `save-load-planning.md` - Design persistent data storage
- `save-load-implementation.md` - Implement NBT serialization
- `save-load-testing.md` - Test data persistence and integrity

### 7. Performance Optimization
- `performance-planning.md` - Plan optimization strategies
- `performance-implementation.md` - Implement rendering and memory optimizations
- `performance-testing.md` - Test performance with large builds

### 8. Version Compatibility
- `compatibility-planning.md` - Plan multi-version support strategy
- `compatibility-implementation.md` - Implement version abstraction layer
- `compatibility-testing.md` - Test across Minecraft versions 1.13-1.21.4

## Labels

All issues use these labels for organization:
- `trd-generated` - Generated from Technical Requirements Document
- `planning` - Planning phase issues
- `implementation` - Implementation phase issues  
- `testing` - Testing phase issues
- `ready-to-implement` - Ready for automatic implementation
- `needs-review` - Requires manual review

## Implementation Order

Recommended implementation order with dependencies:
1. **Development Environment Setup** (foundational)
2. **LEGO Block Definitions** (core building blocks)
3. **Rendering System** (visual foundation)
4. **Placement Mechanics** (building tools)
5. **Inventory and Selection UI** (user interface)
6. **Save/Load Functionality** (persistence)
7. **Performance Optimization** (scalability)
8. **Version Compatibility** (cross-version support)
