## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of LEGO block definitions implementation.

### Feature Summary
Validate that all LEGO brick types are properly implemented with correct 3D models, textures, colors, and metadata handling.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for block registration
- [ ] Write tests for metadata serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Write integration tests for block placement/breaking
- [ ] Test color variant functionality
- [ ] Perform manual testing of all brick types

### Test Scenarios
- Place and break each LEGO brick type in-game
- Verify color variants display correctly
- Test metadata persistence across save/load cycles
- Validate bounding boxes and collision detection
- Test performance with many blocks placed
- Verify textures render at different distances/lighting

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80% for block classes
- [ ] All brick types covered by integration tests
- [ ] Color system fully tested
- [ ] Metadata handling verified

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions Implementation (previous phase)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All block types function correctly in-game
- [ ] Color variants work as expected
- [ ] Metadata persists correctly
- [ ] No rendering or performance issues detected
