## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for implementing persistent storage of LEGO build data within Minecraft worlds.

### Requirement Summary
Design efficient serialization and deserialization methods to store LEGO build data (brick type, color, position, orientation) persistently within Minecraft world data.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Define data structure for LEGO build storage
- [ ] Plan serialization format (NBT, JSON, custom binary)
- [ ] Design world data integration approach
- [ ] Plan backup and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Define data migration strategy for updates
- [ ] Plan compression for large builds

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions completion
- Understanding of Minecraft world save format
- MCP world data access capabilities

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data structure specification complete
- [ ] Serialization format chosen and designed
- [ ] World integration approach defined
- [ ] Backup/recovery strategy planned
- [ ] Migration system designed

### Notes
Consider data size optimization for large LEGO builds and ensure compatibility with Minecraft's existing world save mechanisms.
