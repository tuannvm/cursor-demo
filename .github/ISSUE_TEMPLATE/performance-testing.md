## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of performance optimizations for large LEGO builds.

### Feature Summary
Validate that performance optimizations successfully maintain smooth gameplay and rendering performance even with extremely large LEGO structures.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write performance benchmarking tests
- [ ] Write memory usage monitoring tests
- [ ] Write load testing for large builds
- [ ] Test rendering performance across scenarios
- [ ] Create automated performance regression tests

### Test Scenarios
- Build progressively larger LEGO structures (100, 1K, 10K+ blocks)
- Test performance across different hardware configurations
- Measure frame rates during complex building operations
- Monitor memory usage during extended building sessions
- Test chunk loading/unloading with LEGO builds
- Validate cache effectiveness under various usage patterns
- Test performance during multiplayer scenarios

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for all major operations
- [ ] Memory usage profiles created
- [ ] Frame rate targets validated across scenarios
- [ ] Cache performance metrics verified

### Dependencies
- Performance Optimization Implementation (previous phase)
- All other major modules (for realistic testing scenarios)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] No performance regressions introduced
- [ ] Large build scenarios work smoothly
- [ ] Multiplayer performance acceptable
