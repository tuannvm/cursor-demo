## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of the custom rendering system from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Feature Summary
Testing custom LEGO brick rendering with accurate 3D shapes, performance optimization, and visual quality.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for render logic
- [ ] Write performance tests for large builds
- [ ] Test rendering accuracy across different brick types
- [ ] Perform visual regression testing
- [ ] Test compatibility with shader mods

### Test Scenarios
- Rendering various LEGO brick types and orientations
- Performance with 1000+ blocks visible
- Lighting behavior on LEGO surfaces
- LOD transitions at different distances
- Shader mod compatibility testing
- Render quality at different graphics settings

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80% for rendering classes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Visual tests for all brick types
- [ ] Shader compatibility verified

### Dependencies
- Custom Rendering System implementation completion
- LEGO Block Definitions implementation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All rendering tests pass
- [ ] Visual quality meets LEGO accuracy standards
- [ ] Performance targets met for large builds
- [ ] No rendering artifacts or glitches
- [ ] Shader mod compatibility confirmed
