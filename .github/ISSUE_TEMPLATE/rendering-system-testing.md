## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of the custom rendering system for LEGO blocks.

### Feature Summary
Validate that the custom rendering system accurately displays LEGO brick geometries with proper lighting, textures, and performance optimization.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for renderer registration
- [ ] Write performance tests for rendering optimization
- [ ] Test visual quality across different settings
- [ ] Test LOD system effectiveness
- [ ] Perform manual visual validation testing

### Test Scenarios
- Render large numbers of LEGO blocks simultaneously
- Test rendering at various distances and angles
- Verify lighting accuracy on complex geometries
- Test texture mapping on non-cube shapes
- Validate LOD transitions are smooth and appropriate
- Test rendering performance across different graphics settings
- Verify compatibility with Minecraft shaders/resource packs

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Renderer classes covered by unit tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Visual quality validation across settings
- [ ] LOD system effectiveness verified

### Dependencies
- Rendering System Implementation (previous phase)
- LEGO Block Definitions (for blocks to render)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All rendering tests pass
- [ ] Visual quality meets standards
- [ ] Performance targets achieved
- [ ] LOD system functions correctly
- [ ] Compatible with standard Minecraft rendering features
