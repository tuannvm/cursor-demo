## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of LEGO Block Definitions from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Feature Summary
Testing custom LEGO blocks with proper 3D models, textures, colors, and metadata storage functionality.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for block registration
- [ ] Write unit tests for metadata handling
- [ ] Write integration tests for block placement
- [ ] Perform manual testing in Minecraft
- [ ] Test color variant functionality

### Test Scenarios
- Block placement and removal
- Metadata persistence across world save/load
- Color variant switching
- Block orientation changes
- Collision detection accuracy
- Rendering performance with multiple blocks

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80% for block classes
- [ ] Critical block placement covered by integration tests
- [ ] Block registration and metadata storage tested
- [ ] Color system error handling tests

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions implementation issue completion
- Test framework setup for Minecraft modding

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed successfully
- [ ] Performance acceptable with 100+ blocks
- [ ] No memory leaks with color variants
