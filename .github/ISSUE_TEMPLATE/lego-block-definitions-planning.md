## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for implementing LEGO Block Definitions from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Requirement Summary
Implement various LEGO brick types (e.g., 1x1, 2x1, 2x2) as custom Minecraft blocks. Each brick will have unique 3D models, textures, and support for multiple colors. Metadata will store brick type, color, and orientation.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria for LEGO block types
- [ ] Identify dependencies on MCP and Minecraft block system
- [ ] Estimate effort for model creation and texture development
- [ ] Create implementation strategy for custom block registration
- [ ] Review block metadata storage requirements

### Dependencies
- Development environment setup (Java, MCP, Minecraft Forge)
- Understanding of Minecraft's block registration system
- 3D modeling tools for LEGO brick shapes

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive list of LEGO brick types to support
- [ ] Technical approach defined for custom block creation
- [ ] Metadata storage strategy outlined
- [ ] Color system design completed
- [ ] 3D model and texture requirements specified

### Notes
- Focus on popular LEGO brick types initially (1x1, 2x1, 2x2, 2x4)
- Consider memory usage for multiple color variants
- Plan for future extensibility to additional brick types
