## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for implementing LEGO placement mechanics from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Requirement Summary
Develop a dedicated "LEGO Builder Tool" with snapping system for precise alignment, user-controlled rotation of bricks, and custom collision detection to mimic real LEGO interactions.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Define snapping system requirements and behavior
- [ ] Plan rotation mechanism for LEGO bricks
- [ ] Design collision detection system
- [ ] Identify user input handling requirements
- [ ] Create tool interaction workflow

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions planning completion
- Understanding of Minecraft's item and tool systems
- Player interaction event handling

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Snapping system algorithm defined
- [ ] Rotation controls specified
- [ ] Collision detection rules outlined
- [ ] Tool behavior documented
- [ ] User experience flow designed

### Notes
- Consider both creative and survival mode usage
- Plan for precise alignment to match real LEGO building
- Design intuitive rotation controls (mouse wheel, keyboard)
- Ensure smooth building experience similar to LEGO Digital Designer
