## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for implementing the LEGO Builder Tool with advanced placement mechanics.

### Requirement Summary
Design a dedicated "LEGO Builder Tool" that enables custom placement with snapping system, user-controlled rotation, and custom collision detection to mimic real LEGO interactions.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Define LEGO Builder Tool behavior and controls
- [ ] Plan snapping system algorithm for precise alignment
- [ ] Design rotation system (6-axis rotation support)
- [ ] Plan collision detection for LEGO-specific rules
- [ ] Define user interaction patterns and controls
- [ ] Plan visual feedback system for valid/invalid placements

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions completion
- Understanding of Minecraft's placement mechanics
- MCP tool creation capabilities

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tool behavior specification complete
- [ ] Snapping algorithm designed
- [ ] Rotation system planned
- [ ] Collision detection rules defined
- [ ] User interaction patterns established

### Notes
The placement system should feel intuitive and follow real LEGO building rules - bricks must connect properly and maintain structural integrity.
