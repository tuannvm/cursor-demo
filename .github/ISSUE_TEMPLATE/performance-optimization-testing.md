## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of performance optimization from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Feature Summary
Testing performance optimizations for large LEGO builds to ensure smooth gameplay and efficient resource usage.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test memory usage with large builds
- [ ] Test frame rate stability
- [ ] Test LOD system effectiveness
- [ ] Perform stress testing with massive builds

### Test Scenarios
- Building with 1,000, 10,000, and 50,000+ blocks
- Memory usage monitoring during extended sessions
- Frame rate measurement during complex builds
- LOD transition smoothness testing
- Multi-player performance with large builds
- Build loading time measurement

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Memory leak detection tests implemented
- [ ] Frame rate stability tests passing
- [ ] LOD system validated

### Dependencies
- Performance Optimization implementation completion
- All other core module implementations

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance targets met consistently
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Frame rate remains stable
- [ ] LOD system improves performance
- [ ] Large builds load within acceptable time
