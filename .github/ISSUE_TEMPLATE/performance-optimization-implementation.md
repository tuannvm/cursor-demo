## Implementation Phase

This issue tracks the implementation of performance optimization from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Requirement Summary
Implement performance optimizations to handle large LEGO builds smoothly, including rendering optimizations, memory management, and efficient data structures.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Implement chunk-based rendering optimization
- [ ] Add occlusion culling for hidden blocks
- [ ] Create LOD system for distant structures
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large builds
- [ ] Implement build streaming for massive constructions

### Technical Approach
- Frustum culling and distance-based rendering
- Spatial data structures for efficient queries
- Memory pooling for block instances
- Asynchronous loading for large build sections
- GPU-based instancing for similar blocks

### Files to Modify/Create
- `src/main/java/legomod/performance/ChunkRenderer.java` - Chunk optimization
- `src/main/java/legomod/performance/LODManager.java` - Level of detail
- `src/main/java/legomod/performance/MemoryManager.java` - Memory optimization
- `src/main/java/legomod/performance/BuildStreamer.java` - Build streaming
- Performance profiling utilities

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Smooth performance with 10,000+ blocks
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable
- [ ] LOD system maintains visual quality
- [ ] No frame rate drops during building
- [ ] Efficient loading of saved builds
