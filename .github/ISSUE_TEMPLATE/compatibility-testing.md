## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of version compatibility across all supported Minecraft versions (1.13-1.21.4).

### Feature Summary
Validate that the LEGO Builder Mod functions correctly and consistently across all Minecraft versions supported by MCP-Reborn.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write automated compatibility tests for each version
- [ ] Create version-specific integration test suites
- [ ] Test feature parity across versions
- [ ] Test upgrade/downgrade scenarios
- [ ] Validate resource loading across versions

### Test Scenarios
- Install and run mod on each supported Minecraft version
- Test all major features on oldest and newest versions
- Verify world compatibility when switching versions
- Test mod behavior with version-specific Minecraft features
- Validate performance consistency across versions
- Test multiplayer compatibility with mixed versions
- Verify resource pack compatibility across versions

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] All supported versions tested automatically
- [ ] Feature parity validated across versions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks consistent
- [ ] No version-specific regressions

### Dependencies
- Version Compatibility Implementation (previous phase)
- All other major modules (for comprehensive testing)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Mod works correctly on all supported versions
- [ ] No feature regressions across versions
- [ ] Performance remains consistent
- [ ] World data compatible across versions
- [ ] User experience consistent regardless of version
