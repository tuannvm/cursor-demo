## Implementation Phase

This issue tracks the implementation of version compatibility across Minecraft versions 1.13-1.21.4 supported by MCP-Reborn.

### Requirement Summary
Implement comprehensive version compatibility system that allows the LEGO Builder Mod to function correctly across all supported Minecraft versions through abstraction layers and version-specific adaptations.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create version detection and abstraction system
- [ ] Implement version-specific API adapters
- [ ] Add conditional compilation for version differences
- [ ] Create unified interface for cross-version functionality
- [ ] Implement feature toggling based on version capabilities
- [ ] Add version-specific resource handling

### Technical Approach
- Use reflection and factory patterns for version abstraction
- Implement adapter pattern for API differences
- Create compile-time flags for version-specific code
- Use interface-based design for version independence
- Implement graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Create version-specific resource pack variants

### Files to Modify/Create
- `src/main/java/compatibility/VersionManager.java` - Version detection and management
- `src/main/java/compatibility/adapters/` - Version-specific adapters
- `src/main/java/compatibility/interfaces/` - Unified interfaces
- `src/main/java/compatibility/features/` - Feature compatibility handlers
- `build.gradle` - Multi-version build configuration
- `src/main/resources/version-specific/` - Version-specific resources

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Mod compiles and runs on all supported versions
- [ ] Version-specific features work correctly
- [ ] No functionality loss across versions
- [ ] Graceful degradation where needed
- [ ] Build system supports all target versions

### Ready for Implementation
Add the `ready-to-implement` label when this issue is ready to be automatically implemented.
