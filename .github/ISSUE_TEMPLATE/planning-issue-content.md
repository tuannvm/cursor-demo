## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for implementing the Minecraft LEGO Builder Mod requirement from the Technical Requirements Document (docs/mcp.md).

### Requirement Summary

Implement a virtual LEGO building experience directly into Minecraft Java Edition using the Mod Coder Pack (MCP), allowing users to construct models with custom LEGO bricks similar to LEGO Digital Designer.

### Planning Tasks
- [x] Define acceptance criteria
- [x] Identify dependencies
- [ ] Estimate effort for each component
- [ ] Create implementation strategy
- [ ] Review with stakeholders

### Key Components to Implement

Based on the TRD, the following major components need to be implemented:

1. **LEGO Block Definitions**
   - Various LEGO brick types (1x1, 2x1, 2x2, etc.)
   - Custom Minecraft blocks with unique 3D models and textures
   - Support for multiple colors
   - Metadata storage for brick type, color, and orientation

2. **Placement Mechanics**
   - Dedicated "LEGO Builder Tool"
   - Snapping system for precise alignment
   - User-controlled rotation of bricks
   - Custom collision detection for LEGO interactions

3. **Rendering System**
   - Custom block renderers for non-cube LEGO shapes
   - Custom render IDs registration
   - TileEntitySpecialRender for complex models

4. **Inventory and Selection**
   - Custom in-game UI/palette for brick selection
   - Color selection interface
   - Search and filtering options

5. **Save/Load Functionality**
   - Persistent storage of LEGO build data
   - Serialization/deserialization methods
   - World data integration

### Dependencies

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Mod Coder Pack (MCP) - potentially MCP-Reborn for versions 1.13-1.21.4
- Minecraft Forge (likely required)
- IntelliJ IDEA or similar IDE
- Git for version control

### Technical Challenges Identified

1. **Performance Optimization** - Large LEGO builds may impact performance
2. **Version Compatibility** - Ensure compatibility across Minecraft versions 1.13-1.21.4
3. **Complex Geometry Rendering** - Accurately rendering LEGO shapes within Minecraft's engine
4. **Multiplayer Synchronization** - Server-side build data management

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Foundation**
- Set up MCP development environment
- Create basic LEGO block definitions
- Implement simple placement mechanics

**Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- Develop custom rendering system
- Create LEGO Builder Tool
- Implement snapping and collision detection

**Phase 3: User Interface**
- Build custom inventory/selection UI
- Add color and brick type selection
- Implement search and filtering

**Phase 4: Data Persistence**
- Develop save/load functionality
- Implement world data integration
- Add serialization methods

**Phase 5: Optimization & Polish**
- Performance optimization for large builds
- Cross-version compatibility testing
- Multiplayer support and synchronization

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All key components identified and broken down
- [ ] Technical challenges documented with potential solutions
- [ ] Implementation phases defined with clear deliverables
- [ ] Dependencies identified and documented
- [ ] Effort estimates provided for each component
- [ ] Ready to create implementation issues for each component

### Notes

- The mod should leverage MCP for Minecraft integration
- Focus on client-side rendering and user input initially
- Server-side components will be needed for multiplayer support
- Consider using Minecraft Forge alongside MCP for easier mod development
- Performance optimization will be crucial for large LEGO builds
