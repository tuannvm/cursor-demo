- [ ] Identify block registration approach in MCP

### Dependencies
- Development Environment Setup completion
- MCP block registration system understanding
- Minecraft block model format research

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete LEGO brick type specification
- [ ] Color system design finalized
- [ ] Metadata structure defined
- [ ] Asset organization plan created
- [ ] Block registration strategy established

### Notes
Consider starting with basic brick types (1x1, 2x1, 2x2, 2x4) and common LEGO colors (red, blue, green, yellow, white, black) for initial implementation.
