## Implementation Phase

This issue tracks the implementation of LEGO block definitions as custom Minecraft blocks.

### Requirement Summary
Implement various LEGO brick types as custom Minecraft blocks with 3D models, textures, colors, and metadata storage for brick type, color, and orientation.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create custom block classes for each LEGO brick type
- [ ] Implement block registration system
- [ ] Create 3D models for each brick type
- [ ] Design and implement texture system
- [ ] Add metadata handling for color and orientation
- [ ] Implement color variants for each brick type

### Technical Approach
- Extend Minecraft Block class for custom LEGO blocks
- Use block states for orientation and color variants
- Create custom item models and block models
- Implement proper bounding boxes for each brick shape
- Use NBT data for complex metadata storage

### Files to Modify/Create
- `src/main/java/blocks/LegoBlockBase.java` - Base class for LEGO blocks
- `src/main/java/blocks/` - Individual block type classes
- `src/main/java/registry/BlockRegistry.java` - Block registration
- `src/main/resources/assets/models/block/` - Block models
- `src/main/resources/assets/models/item/` - Item models
- `src/main/resources/assets/textures/blocks/` - Block textures

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All planned LEGO brick types implemented
- [ ] Color variants working correctly
- [ ] Metadata storage and retrieval functional
- [ ] 3D models render correctly in-game
- [ ] Blocks can be placed and broken normally

### Ready for Implementation
Add the `ready-to-implement` label when this issue is ready to be automatically implemented.
