## Implementation Phase

This issue tracks the implementation of LEGO Block Definitions from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Requirement Summary
Create custom Minecraft blocks that represent various LEGO brick types with proper 3D models, textures, multiple colors, and metadata storage.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create custom block classes for different LEGO brick types
- [ ] Implement 3D models for non-cube LEGO shapes
- [ ] Create texture system supporting multiple colors
- [ ] Add metadata handling for brick type, color, and orientation
- [ ] Register blocks with Minecraft's block registry

### Technical Approach
- Extend Minecraft's Block class for custom LEGO blocks
- Use custom blockstates for orientation and color variants
- Implement custom bounding boxes for accurate collision detection
- Store metadata using block properties or tile entities

### Files to Modify/Create
- `src/main/java/legomod/blocks/` - LEGO block classes
- `src/main/resources/assets/legomod/blockstates/` - Block state definitions
- `src/main/resources/assets/legomod/models/` - 3D models
- `src/main/resources/assets/legomod/textures/` - Block textures
- Block registration handler

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multiple LEGO brick types work as custom blocks
- [ ] Blocks support multiple color variants
- [ ] Metadata correctly stores brick properties
- [ ] Blocks render with proper 3D shapes
- [ ] Orientation system functional

### Ready for Implementation
Add the `ready-to-implement` label when this issue is ready to be automatically implemented.
