## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of the LEGO brick selection and management UI system.

### Feature Summary
Validate that the custom LEGO palette UI provides smooth, intuitive brick selection with working search, filtering, and color selection features.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for search algorithms
- [ ] Write tests for filter functionality
- [ ] Write integration tests for UI state management
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness and performance
- [ ] Perform usability testing with complex scenarios

### Test Scenarios
- Open UI and browse through all available blocks
- Test search with various keywords and partial matches
- Use filters in different combinations
- Select different colors for the same brick type
- Test UI performance with large numbers of blocks
- Validate UI state persistence across game sessions
- Test keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80% for UI logic
- [ ] Search functionality thoroughly tested
- [ ] Filter combinations validated
- [ ] UI state persistence verified

### Dependencies
- Inventory and Selection UI Implementation (previous phase)
- LEGO Block Definitions (for blocks to display)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All UI functionality tests pass
- [ ] Search and filtering work as expected
- [ ] UI performs well under load
- [ ] State persistence functions correctly
- [ ] Usability standards met
