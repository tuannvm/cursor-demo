## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of the LEGO build data persistence system.

### Feature Summary
Validate that LEGO build data is accurately saved, loaded, and preserved across game sessions with proper error handling and performance optimization.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Write integration tests for world save/load cycles
- [ ] Test data integrity across sessions
- [ ] Test performance with large builds
- [ ] Test backup and recovery mechanisms

### Test Scenarios
- Build complex LEGO structures and save/reload world
- Test data persistence across Minecraft version updates
- Simulate save corruption and validate recovery
- Test performance with builds containing thousands of blocks
- Verify incremental save functionality
- Test world backup and restore procedures
- Validate data migration between mod versions

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80% for data handling
- [ ] All save/load scenarios covered
- [ ] Data integrity validation automated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

### Dependencies
- Save/Load Functionality Implementation (previous phase)
- LEGO Block Definitions (for test data)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All data persistence tests pass
- [ ] No data loss in normal operation
- [ ] Performance meets targets for large builds
- [ ] Backup/recovery system functions correctly
- [ ] Data migration works seamlessly
