## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for implementing save/load functionality from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Requirement Summary
Plan persistent storage for LEGO build data (brick type, color, position, orientation) within Minecraft world data with efficient serialization methods.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Design data structure for LEGO builds
- [ ] Plan serialization format and compression
- [ ] Design integration with Minecraft's save system
- [ ] Plan backup and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Design import/export functionality

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions planning completion
- Understanding of Minecraft's NBT and world data systems
- Data persistence requirements analysis

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data structure design completed
- [ ] Serialization strategy defined
- [ ] World integration approach planned
- [ ] Backup/recovery system designed
- [ ] Import/export format specified

### Notes
- Consider data migration between mod versions
- Plan for compressed storage of large builds
- Design for both single-player and multiplayer worlds
- Consider sharing builds between players
