## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for implementing custom rendering for LEGO blocks with non-cube shapes.

### Requirement Summary
Design custom block renderers to display the non-cube shapes of LEGO bricks accurately, including custom render IDs and potentially TileEntitySpecialRender for complex models.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Research MCP custom rendering capabilities
- [ ] Plan render architecture for non-cube blocks
- [ ] Design TileEntitySpecialRender approach for complex models
- [ ] Plan LOD (Level of Detail) system for performance
- [ ] Design lighting and shading for LEGO brick studs
- [ ] Plan texture UV mapping for complex geometries

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions completion
- MCP rendering system documentation
- Minecraft's block rendering pipeline understanding

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rendering architecture designed
- [ ] TileEntity approach planned for complex shapes
- [ ] LOD system designed for performance
- [ ] Lighting and shading approach defined
- [ ] UV mapping strategy established

### Notes
Focus on maintaining Minecraft's visual style while accurately representing LEGO brick geometry, including the characteristic studs and connection points.
