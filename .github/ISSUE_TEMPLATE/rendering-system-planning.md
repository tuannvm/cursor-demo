## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for implementing custom rendering system from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Requirement Summary
Develop custom block renderers to display the non-cube shapes of LEGO bricks accurately. This involves registering custom render IDs and potentially using TileEntitySpecialRender for complex models.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Research Minecraft's rendering pipeline and custom renderers
- [ ] Define rendering approach for non-cube LEGO shapes
- [ ] Plan TileEntitySpecialRender vs custom block renderer usage
- [ ] Identify performance considerations for complex models
- [ ] Design LOD (Level of Detail) system for optimization

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions planning completion
- Understanding of Minecraft's rendering system
- 3D modeling capabilities for LEGO brick shapes

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rendering approach defined (block renderer vs TESR)
- [ ] Performance optimization strategy planned
- [ ] Model complexity guidelines established
- [ ] Texture mapping approach specified
- [ ] LOD system designed for large builds

### Notes
- Balance visual accuracy with performance
- Consider using simplified models for distant viewing
- Plan for compatibility with shaders and render mods
- Ensure proper lighting and shadow support
