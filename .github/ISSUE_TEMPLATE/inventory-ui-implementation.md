## Implementation Phase

This issue tracks the implementation of the inventory and selection UI from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Requirement Summary
Create a custom in-game user interface (UI) or palette that allows users to select different LEGO brick types and colors, potentially including search and filtering options.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create custom GUI screen for brick selection
- [ ] Implement brick type categorization and display
- [ ] Add color picker/selector for each brick type
- [ ] Implement search functionality for brick types
- [ ] Add filtering options (by size, color, category)

### Technical Approach
- Extend GuiScreen for custom LEGO palette interface
- Use ItemStacks to represent different brick variants
- Implement custom GUI components for color selection
- Add search algorithm for quick brick finding
- Create filtering system with multiple criteria

### Files to Modify/Create
- `src/main/java/legomod/gui/LegoBuilderGui.java` - Main UI class
- `src/main/java/legomod/gui/ColorSelector.java` - Color picker component
- `src/main/java/legomod/gui/BrickPalette.java` - Brick selection grid
- `src/main/java/legomod/client/GuiHandler.java` - GUI registration
- Texture files for UI elements

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UI displays all available LEGO brick types
- [ ] Color selection works for all brick types
- [ ] Search functionality finds bricks by name/type
- [ ] Filtering works correctly
- [ ] UI is intuitive and responsive
