## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for addressing performance optimization challenges from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Requirement Summary
Optimize performance for large LEGO builds to ensure smooth gameplay and rendering even with thousands of LEGO blocks.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks in large builds
- [ ] Define acceptable performance targets
- [ ] Research optimization techniques for Minecraft mods
- [ ] Plan chunk loading optimization strategies
- [ ] Design LOD system for distant LEGO structures

### Dependencies
- LEGO Block Definitions and Rendering System planning
- Understanding of Minecraft's performance characteristics
- Profiling tools for performance measurement

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance targets defined (FPS, memory usage)
- [ ] Optimization strategy documented
- [ ] Bottleneck analysis completed
- [ ] LOD system designed
- [ ] Chunk optimization approach planned

### Notes
- Target: Smooth performance with 10,000+ LEGO blocks
- Consider occlusion culling for hidden blocks
- Plan for both client and server optimization
- Design efficient data structures for build storage
