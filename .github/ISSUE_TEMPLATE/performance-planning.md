## Planning Phase

This issue tracks the planning phase for optimizing performance with large LEGO builds, addressing key technical challenges identified in the TRD.

### Requirement Summary
Plan comprehensive performance optimization strategies to handle large LEGO builds without impacting Minecraft's gameplay performance, including rendering, memory usage, and computational efficiency.

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks and metrics
- [ ] Plan chunk loading optimization for LEGO builds
- [ ] Design memory management strategy
- [ ] Plan rendering optimization (LOD, culling)
- [ ] Define performance benchmarks and targets
- [ ] Plan caching strategies for complex calculations

### Dependencies
- Understanding of Minecraft's performance characteristics
- LEGO Block Definitions implementation approach
- Rendering System architecture

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified
- [ ] Optimization strategies planned
- [ ] Benchmarks and targets established
- [ ] Memory management approach defined
- [ ] Caching strategy designed

### Notes
Focus on optimizations that maintain the quality of the LEGO building experience while ensuring Minecraft remains playable with large structures.
