## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of LEGO placement mechanics from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Feature Summary
Testing the LEGO Builder Tool's snapping system, rotation controls, and collision detection functionality.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for snapping algorithm
- [ ] Write unit tests for rotation logic
- [ ] Write integration tests for collision detection
- [ ] Perform manual testing of placement mechanics
- [ ] Test performance with rapid placement

### Test Scenarios
- Precise brick alignment on various surfaces
- Rotation through all valid orientations
- Collision detection with existing bricks
- Snapping behavior with different brick types
- Tool responsiveness during rapid building
- Edge cases (world boundaries, invalid positions)

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80% for placement logic
- [ ] All rotation states covered by tests
- [ ] Collision detection edge cases tested
- [ ] Performance tests for rapid placement

### Dependencies
- LEGO Builder Tool implementation completion
- LEGO Block Definitions implementation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All placement mechanics tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing shows smooth building experience
- [ ] Performance acceptable during intensive building
- [ ] No placement glitches or invalid states
