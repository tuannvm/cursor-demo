## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of the LEGO Builder Tool placement mechanics implementation.

### Feature Summary
Validate that the LEGO Builder Tool correctly handles snapping, rotation, collision detection, and provides appropriate visual feedback.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for snapping algorithms
- [ ] Write tests for rotation calculations
- [ ] Write integration tests for collision detection
- [ ] Test visual feedback system
- [ ] Perform extensive manual testing

### Test Scenarios
- Place bricks in various configurations and orientations
- Test snapping precision across different brick types
- Verify rotation works in all axes
- Test collision detection prevents overlapping/invalid placements
- Validate tool works correctly in multiplayer environments
- Test performance with complex LEGO structures

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80% for placement mechanics
- [ ] All snapping scenarios covered
- [ ] Rotation edge cases tested
- [ ] Collision detection thoroughly validated

### Dependencies
- Placement Mechanics Implementation (previous phase)
- LEGO Block Definitions (for testing with actual blocks)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All placement tests pass
- [ ] Snapping system works accurately
- [ ] Rotation system responds correctly
- [ ] Collision detection prevents all invalid states
- [ ] Tool performance acceptable under load
