## Implementation Phase

This issue tracks the implementation of performance optimizations for handling large LEGO builds efficiently.

### Requirement Summary
Implement comprehensive performance optimizations including rendering optimizations, memory management, caching systems, and computational efficiency improvements for large LEGO structures.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Implement chunk-based LEGO build loading
- [ ] Add rendering optimizations (frustum culling, LOD)
- [ ] Create memory pooling for LEGO objects
- [ ] Implement caching for placement calculations
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and profiling tools
- [ ] Optimize data structures for large builds

### Technical Approach
- Use spatial data structures (octrees, quad trees) for efficient queries
- Implement distance-based rendering optimizations
- Create object pools to reduce garbage collection
- Use multithreading for background calculations
- Implement smart caching with LRU eviction
- Add performance profiling hooks for monitoring

### Files to Modify/Create
- `src/main/java/optimization/ChunkManager.java` - Chunk-based loading
- `src/main/java/optimization/RenderOptimizer.java` - Rendering optimizations
- `src/main/java/optimization/MemoryManager.java` - Memory management
- `src/main/java/optimization/CacheManager.java` - Caching system
- `src/main/java/profiling/PerformanceProfiler.java` - Performance monitoring
- `src/main/java/datastructures/SpatialIndex.java` - Spatial data structures

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Large builds (1000+ blocks) load smoothly
- [ ] Rendering performance maintains 60+ FPS
- [ ] Memory usage stays within reasonable bounds
- [ ] Cache hit rates achieve targets (>80%)
- [ ] Background calculations don't block gameplay

### Ready for Implementation
