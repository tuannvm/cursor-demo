## Testing Phase

This issue tracks the testing of save/load functionality from the Technical Requirements Document.

### Feature Summary
Testing persistent storage and retrieval of LEGO build data with proper serialization and world integration.

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Write integration tests for world data storage
- [ ] Test data integrity across save/load cycles
- [ ] Test performance with large builds
- [ ] Test error handling for corrupted data

### Test Scenarios
- Saving and loading simple LEGO builds
- Handling large builds with thousands of blocks
- Data corruption recovery
- World migration between mod versions
- Multiplayer synchronization testing
- Import/export functionality validation

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80% for data classes
- [ ] Serialization edge cases covered
- [ ] Large build performance tested
- [ ] Data integrity verification tests

### Dependencies
- LEGO Build Save/Load System implementation completion
- Test world setup with various build sizes

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All save/load tests pass
- [ ] Data integrity maintained across cycles
- [ ] Performance acceptable for large builds
- [ ] Error recovery works correctly
- [ ] No data loss in any scenario
