# Implement Minecraft LEGO Builder Mod

## Overview
This issue tracks the implementation of a Minecraft LEGO Builder Mod as outlined in the Technical Requirements Document (`docs/mcp.md`). The mod will integrate a virtual LEGO building experience directly into Minecraft Java Edition using the Mod Coder Pack (MCP).

## Technical Requirements Reference
See the complete technical specifications in [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md).

## Implementation Tasks

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
- [ ] Set up development environment with MCP/Forge
- [ ] Create basic mod structure and configuration
- [ ] Establish version compatibility framework (1.13-1.21.4)

### ðŸ§± Phase 2: LEGO Block System
- [ ] Define LEGO brick types (1x1, 2x1, 2x2, etc.)
- [ ] Create 3D models for each brick type
- [ ] Implement texture system for multiple colors
- [ ] Add metadata storage (brick type, color, orientation)

### ðŸ”§ Phase 3: Placement Mechanics
- [ ] Develop LEGO Builder Tool item
- [ ] Implement snapping system for precise alignment
- [ ] Add brick rotation controls
- [ ] Create custom collision detection for LEGO interactions

### ðŸŽ¨ Phase 4: Rendering System
- [ ] Custom block renderers for non-cube LEGO shapes
- [ ] Register custom render IDs
- [ ] Implement `TileEntitySpecialRender` for complex models
- [ ] Optimize rendering performance for large builds

### ðŸŽ® Phase 5: User Interface
- [ ] Design LEGO brick selection palette
- [ ] Implement color picker interface
- [ ] Add search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Create inventory management for LEGO pieces

### ðŸ’¾ Phase 6: Data Management
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality for LEGO builds
- [ ] Create efficient serialization methods
- [ ] Integrate with Minecraft world data storage
- [ ] Add multiplayer synchronization support

### ðŸš€ Phase 7: Optimization & Polish
- [ ] Performance optimization for large builds
- [ ] Cross-version compatibility testing
- [ ] Documentation and user guides
- [ ] Beta testing and bug fixes

## Technical Challenges to Address
1. **Performance**: Optimize rendering and data storage for large LEGO builds
2. **Compatibility**: Ensure support across MCP-supported Minecraft versions
3. **Rendering**: Accurately display complex LEGO geometries within Minecraft's engine
4. **Multiplayer**: Handle synchronization of LEGO builds across players

## Development Environment
- **Language**: Java
- **Platform**: Minecraft Java Edition
- **Framework**: Mod Coder Pack (MCP) + Minecraft Forge
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can place and manipulate LEGO bricks within Minecraft
- [ ] Bricks snap together realistically like physical LEGO
- [ ] Multiple colors and brick types are available
- [ ] Builds can be saved and loaded persistently
- [ ] Performance remains stable with large constructions
- [ ] Compatible with specified Minecraft versions
