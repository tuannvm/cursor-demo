# Implement Minecraft LEGO Builder Mod

## üìù Description
Implement a comprehensive LEGO building experience within Minecraft Java Edition using the Mod Coder Pack (MCP), as outlined in the Technical Requirements Document (`docs/mcp.md`). This mod will allow players to construct models using virtual LEGO bricks with advanced placement mechanics and rendering capabilities.

## üéØ Objectives
- Create a virtual LEGO Digital Designer-like experience in Minecraft
- Support multiple LEGO brick types, colors, and precise placement mechanics
- Ensure compatibility across Minecraft versions 1.13-1.21.4 (MCP-Reborn supported versions)
- Provide intuitive user interface for brick selection and building

## üìã Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- [ ] **Rotation & Orientation** (#TBD)
  - Implement user-controlled brick rotation (90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞)
  - Support for vertical brick placement
  - Add keybindings for rotation controls

### Phase 3: Visual & Rendering System
- [ ] **Custom Block Renderers** (#TBD)
  - Develop custom render system for non-cube LEGO shapes
  - Register custom render IDs for each brick type
  - Implement `TileEntitySpecialRender` for complex brick models
  - Ensure proper lighting and shadow rendering

- [ ] **3D Models & Textures** (#TBD)
  - Create accurate 3D models for each LEGO brick type
  - Design high-quality textures with proper LEGO brick detail
  - Implement texture atlasing for optimal performance
  - Add model variants for different colors

### Phase 4: User Interface
- [ ] **In-Game UI/Palette** (#TBD)
  - Design and implement brick selection interface
  - Create color picker with LEGO-standard colors
  - Add search and filtering functionality
  - Implement inventory-style brick organization

- [ ] **HUD & Information Display** (#TBD)
  - Show current selected brick type and color
  - Display placement guides and measurements
  - Add brick count tracker
  - Implement build progress indicators

### Phase 5: Data Management
- [ ] **Save/Load System** (#TBD)
  - Design efficient serialization for LEGO build data
  - Implement world data storage integration
  - Create backup and recovery mechanisms
  - Support for exporting builds to external formats

- [ ] **Multiplayer Support** (#TBD)
  - Implement server-side build data synchronization
  - Add permission system for collaborative building
  - Create conflict resolution for simultaneous editing
  - Network optimization for large builds

### Phase 6: Performance & Optimization
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** (#TBD)
  - Implement LOD (Level of Detail) system for large builds
  - Optimize rendering for complex structures
  - Add chunk loading optimizations
  - Memory usage optimization for extensive builds

- [ ] **Compatibility Testing** (#TBD)
  - Test across supported Minecraft versions (1.13-1.21.4)
  - Verify compatibility with other popular mods
  - Performance testing on various hardware configurations
  - Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## üö® Technical Challenges
- **Performance**: Rendering and managing large numbers of custom blocks
- **Compatibility**: Ensuring stable operation across multiple Minecraft versions
- **Geometry**: Accurately representing complex LEGO shapes in Minecraft's block-based world
- **User Experience**: Creating intuitive building mechanics that feel natural
- **Multiplayer**: Synchronizing complex build data across clients

## üõ† Technology Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Mod Framework**: Mod Coder Pack (MCP) with Minecraft Forge
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Build Tool**: Gradle (via Forge)
